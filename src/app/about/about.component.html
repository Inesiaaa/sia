            <p>Hi there! I’m <span class="highlight">Sherylane Ines Aglubat</span>, though most people know me as <span class="highlight">Sia</span>, my nickname and initials. I’m a <span class="highlight">Front-End Software Engineer</span> focused on building reliable, user-centred web experiences that balance visual clarity with technical quality.</p>
            <p>I work across a range of environments—from client and commercial websites to enterprise-level applications—adapting to different requirements, tools, and team structures. I value clean code, maintainable styles, and thoughtful interfaces, and enjoy collaborating with designers, developers, and stakeholders to deliver solutions that are practical, scalable, and easy to use.</p>
            <p>Outside of delivery, I’m always refining my skills and exploring better ways to build responsive, accessible, and performant interfaces.</p>
            <p class="highlight">Let’s create something exceptional together.</p>
